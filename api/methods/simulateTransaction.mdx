Submit a trial contract invocation to get back return values, expected ledger footprint, and expected costs.

## Parameters

- `<xdr.TransactionEnvelope>` - The transaction to be simulated (serialized in base64)

## Returns

- `<object>`
  - `cost`: `<object>` - Information about the fees expected, instructions used, etc.
    - `cpuInsns`: `<string>` - Stringified-number of the total cpu instructions consumed by this transaction
    - `memBytes`: `<string>` - Stringified-number of the total memory bytes allocated by this transaction
  - `results`: `<object[]>` - If error is present then results will not be in the response. There will be one results object for each operation in the transaction.
    - `xdr`: `<xdr.ScVal>` - (optional) Only present on success. xdr-encoded return value of the contract call operation.
    - `footprint`: `<xdr.LedgerFootprint>` - The contract data ledger keys which were accessed when simulating this operation. (serialized in a base64 string)
    - `auth`: `<xdr.ContractAuth[]>` - Per-address authorizations recorded when simulating this operation. (an array of serialized base64 strings)
    - `events`: `<xdr.DiagnosticEvent[]>` - Events emitted during the contract invocation. (an array of serialized base64 strings)
  - `latestLedger`: `<string>` - Stringified-number of the current latest ledger observed by the node when this response was generated.
  - `error`: `<string>` - (optional) only present if the transaction failed. This field will include more details from `stellar-core` about why the invoke host function call failed.

## Examples

The example transaction below invokes the `increment` function from the [`increment` example contract].
